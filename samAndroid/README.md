**Android application for the [SAM](https://github.com/cascer1/deltasam) project.**

In the past, every project had its own administration regarding time tracking and peer reviews. This required tutors to put extra time and effort into getting an overview of how their groups are doing. We say **no more!**. Using our platform, students can easily track their time and leave peer reviews, and tutors can get a quick overview of the reviews for a group and how much time each member puts into a project. This makes it easier for groups and tutors to work together and find potential problems sooner.
